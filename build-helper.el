;;; Commentary:
;; build-helper helps you set your build configurations in order.
;; enabling you to have different commands to build, run, test, etc.. per project
;; these commands persist across Emacs sessions and in the same project
;; different major modes can have different run commands

;; Todo:
;; build-helper--targets gets a duplicate entry every time we add a command

;;; Usage:
;; For a quick setup add these lines to your init.el
;;
;; (require 'build-helper)
;; (build-helper-setup)
;;
;; and M-x build-helper-run to build
;; you can then use M-x build-helper-re-run to run the last command
;;
;; you can bind these to your preferred keys, however there are convinience
;; functions that run and re-run common targets (run, build, test)
;; these have the name build-helper-run-TARGET and build-helper-re-run-TARGET
;; replacing target with one of the 3 preset targets
;;
;; Advanced functionality
;; build-helper can also run functions from other packages, for example
;; if you use cmake-ide-mode, you will most certainly want to execute
;; `cmake-ide-compile' when executing the run target on c++-mode
;; to achieve this add the following code to the init.el file
;;
;; (build-helper-add-function 'c++-mode 'run #'cmake-ide-compile)
;;
;; This adds the function `cmake-ide-compile' to be executed when the user
;; executes the "run" target in c++-mode on any project
;;
;; Function return values:
;; The return value of the executed functions is checked, when t no other function
;; will be executed and the user will not be prompted for a command.
;; If all the functions return nil the user will be prompted as usual
;;
;; To ensure a function returns t you can add the following instead
;;
;; (build-helper-add-function 'c++-mode 'run #'(lambda () (cmake-ide-compile) t))
